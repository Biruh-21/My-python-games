<h2>Blackjack</h2>

Blackjack is a card game that pits player versus dealer. It is played with one or more decks of cards. Cards are counted as their respective numbers, face cards as ten, and ace as either eleven or one (in our game it will show on the counter as an 11 unless you are over 21). The object of Blackjack is the beat the dealer. This can be accomplished by getting Blackjack (first two cards equal 21) without dealer Blackjack, having your final card count be higher than the dealers without exceeding 21, or by not exceeding 21 and dealer busting by exceeding their card count of 21.

<h2>Higher-Lower</h2>

It's easy to play. You will be shown two cards. You simply have to decide which card has more followers. As you progress, you will be shown a new card. The objective is to get the most right in a row. If you get one wrong, you lose the game.

<h2>The-US-States</h2>

This game asks for the firty states of the unites states of america, and it will put the states you name on the map. and after finishing playing the game it will prepare a .csv list that contains the states that you forgot.

<h2>Snake-Game</h2>

This is the snake game that I love the most. It has a feature so it can hold your previous high score even after you close and rerun the code. I hope you will love it. Make a fun.

<h2>Turtle-Crossing-game</h2>

In this game you have your turtle and the goal of the game to help your turtle cross the road in front of it without being killed by any of the cars passing. The speed of the cars increases as you promote to the next levels.
